# Research Methodology: Whisper Analysis on Mac M4

## Research Design
This study employs a quantitative experimental approach to analyze OpenAI's Whisper speech recognition system performance on Apple Silicon hardware.

## Data Collection Methods

### Audio Sample Preparation
- **Synthetic Audio**: Generated using macOS text-to-speech (`say` command)
- **Sample Rate**: Standardized to 16kHz (Whisper requirement)
- **Duration**: 10-second test phrase for consistency
- **Content**: Technical phrase including brand name for quality assessment

### Performance Metrics
- **Load Time**: Model initialization duration
- **Transcription Time**: Audio-to-text processing duration
- **Accuracy**: Character and word-level comparison with ground truth
- **Quality Issues**: Categorized transcription errors

## Analysis Techniques

### Benchmarking Protocol
1. **Model Loading**: Measure initialization time for each model size
2. **Transcription Testing**: Process identical audio with each model
3. **Quality Assessment**: Compare outputs against known ground truth
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Evaluate robustness with challenging audio

### Tools and Environment
- **Hardware**: Mac M4 with Apple Silicon MPS acceleration
- **Software**: Python 3.11, OpenAI Whisper, Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries**: librosa, matplotlib, pandas, soundfile
- **Analysis**: Statistical comparison and visualization

## Experimental Controls
- **Consistent Audio**: Same test file across all models
- **Standardized Environment**: Identical hardware and software setup
- **Multiple Runs**: Verified reproducibility of results
- **Systematic Testing**: Sequential model testing to avoid interference

## Limitations
- **Single Audio Sample**: Limited to one test phrase
- **Synthetic Audio**: May not represent real-world speech variations
- **Hardware Specific**: Results specific to Mac M4 architecture
- **Model Availability**: Medium/Large models limited by download issues

## Reproducibility
All code, data, and analysis methods documented in Jupyter notebook for full reproducibility.

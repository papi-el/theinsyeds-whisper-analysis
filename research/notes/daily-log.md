## July 1, 2025 - Initial Setup and Analysis

### Objectives
- Set up Whisper on Mac M4
- Benchmark model performance
- Analyze transcription quality
- Test edge cases

### Key Findings
- Mac M4 MPS acceleration provides 17-27x real-time processing
- Base model offers best balance of speed and accuracy
- All models struggle with unique brand names ("Insyeds" â†’ "Insides")
- No hallucinations observed in edge case testing

### Technical Notes
- Medium model download failed due to SHA256 checksum error
- FP16 falls back to FP32 on CPU (expected behavior)
- Model caching significantly improves subsequent load times

### Next Steps
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Develop beginner-friendly guides
- Prepare for publication on GitHub and social media
